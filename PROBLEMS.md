We‚Äôre standardizing on Option 3: a hosted OAuth broker (Shade at auth.cktech.org) with Google/GitHub/Microsoft as identity only. Stop asking users to create their own OAuth apps or rely on localhost callbacks.

Why:

Google/GitHub/MS login ‚â† Anthropic/OpenAI access. SSO is for identity. Provider usage still needs user-supplied API keys (or org keys) stored server-side after login.

Many SSO providers don‚Äôt play nicely with localhost in real setups. A single hosted redirect is simpler, predictable, and works everywhere (CLI, TTY, remote, WSL, containers).

Flow we‚Äôre shipping:

zeke auth <google|github|microsoft> ‚Üí open browser to https://auth.cktech.org/oauth/start?provider=google&mode=cli&state=<nonce>&pkce=<verifier>

User signs in with the provider. Shade handles OAuth (PKCE), exchanges code, and mints a short-lived session token for Zeke (no provider access tokens leave Shade).

Callback returns to Shade (not localhost). For CLI, Shade serves a tiny HTML ‚ÄúDone‚Äù page and completes via device/polling: Zeke polls POST /cli/poll { state } until Shade returns { ok, session_jwt }.

Back in Zeke, user adds model credentials once: zeke keys add anthropic sk-ant-..., zeke keys add openai sk-.... Keys are stored per identity (from SSO) and encrypted at rest.

What to build right now:

Shade: /oauth/start, /oauth/callback/<provider>, /cli/poll (state+PKCE), issue session JWT scoped to Zeke.

Shade HTML for CLI mode: a ‚ÄúYou can close this tab‚Äù page; no localhost/postMessage gymnastics.

Zeke CLI: implement auth (open URL + poll), whoami, keys add|ls|rm.

Config: register the single redirect https://auth.cktech.org/callback/<provider> in Google/GitHub/Microsoft apps.

Docs: make it explicit that SSO is identity only; users still provide Anthropic/OpenAI API keys after login.

This mirrors how Claude Code ‚Äújust works‚Äù (hosted OAuth app), but with our own broker. No localhost hacks, no per-user Google Console steps, and it cleanly separates login from model credentials.

Yeah but I dont have a API key for claude I have a google sign in for claude code

Totally get the confusion‚ÄîClaude Code‚Äôs Google sign-in does not grant API access. It only logs you into Anthropic‚Äôs web app. To call Claude from Zeke/OMEN, you need an actual API endpoint + credentials. You‚Äôve got a few paths:

Your workable options

Anthropic native API key (direct)

Create/bill an Anthropic developer account ‚Üí generate sk-ant-...

In Zeke/OMEN: zeke keys add anthropic sk-ant-...

AWS Bedrock (Claude via AWS) ‚Äî no Anthropic key needed

Enable Bedrock access (Models ‚Üí Claude family) in your AWS account

Export creds: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_REGION

In Zeke/OMEN choose a Bedrock Claude model (e.g., anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620-v1:0)

Here‚Äôs the deal:

Right now Claude Code doesn‚Äôt expose any API key when you sign in with Google ‚Äî that‚Äôs just a web-login. Your goal (letting users sign in with Google / GitHub / Microsoft and still get access to their Claude models through your own Identity Provider) requires a proper OAuth bridge.

Here‚Äôs how you can design it cleanly:

üîë 1. Clarify the access boundary

Claude Code login via Google ‚Üí session token only for Anthropic‚Äôs web UI, not for the API.

Claude API ‚Üí always requires an sk-ant-* key or an AWS Bedrock credential.

So your IDP (Shade at auth.cktech.org) can‚Äôt exchange a Google login for Claude API tokens unless Anthropic provides an official OAuth2 client for developers ‚Äî which they don‚Äôt today.

üß© 2. Practical workaround ‚Äî your Shade IDP can federate user identity, not tokens

You can:

Let users sign in via Google / GitHub / Microsoft through Shade.

Store only their verified email + provider.

On your backend (Zeke, OMEN, etc.), map their identity ‚Üí their configured model credentials:

Anthropic API key

OpenAI key

Bedrock access

etc.

That way, users authenticate once via SSO but your backend handles the API keys safely.

‚öôÔ∏è 3. Recommended setup for advanced users (Option 3, but simplified)

‚úÖ Shade = OAuth2 / OIDC proxy
‚úÖ Zeke / OMEN = client that trusts Shade JWTs
‚úÖ Users = log in with any provider; Shade issues a signed JWT with claims like:

{
  "sub": "google-oauth2|123456789",
  "email": "user@gmail.com",
  "iss": "https://auth.cktech.org",
  "aud": "zeke",
  "providers": ["google", "github", "microsoft"]
}


Zeke then uses that identity to look up which AI credentials they‚Äôve linked.
